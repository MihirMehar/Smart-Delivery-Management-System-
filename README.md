## How It Works:
1. **Order Creation:** Customers create orders via the order service, which generates an order ID and stores the order details in the database.
2. **Delivery Tracking:** The delivery service tracks and updates the delivery status, allowing customers to view their delivery progress.
3. **Customer Notifications:** The notification service sends email/SMS notifications to customers about order and delivery status.
4. **Microservice Communication:** All services communicate through REST APIs and are orchestrated via Spring Cloud and the API Gateway.
